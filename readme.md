Postmortem

This was a twitter robot I wrote a while back when I thought it'd be interesting to see what Google would suggest if I fed it chains of common words.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize it'd be mostly mundane.

I abandoned the bot and project when Heroku sent me a huge bill out of nowhere.  It was a glitch in their billing system, but as a college student, I was not happy even imagining that so i shut it down.
